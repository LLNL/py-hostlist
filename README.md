## Description

py-hostlist processes slurm-style hostlist strings and can return those strings in manipulated fashion. 

## Documentation

Full documentation on py-hostlist can be found at [ReadtheDocs](https://py-hostlist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).

## Contributions

Contributing to Spack is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[py-hostlist repository](https://github.com/LLNL/py-hostlist).

Your PR must pass py-hostlist's unit tests. We enforce these guidelines with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/LLNL/py-hostlist). To run these tests locally, and for helpful tips on git, see our [Contribution Guide](https://py-hostlist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

Spack uses a rough approximation of the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. The ``develop`` branch contains the latest contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points to the latest stable release.
