Developer Guide
===============

This guide is intended for people who want to work on py-hostlist itself. 

Overview
--------

py-hostlist is designed with two separate roles in mind:

 1. **Users**, who need to use the hostlist tool without knowing all of the details about how it is built.

 2. **Developers** who work on py-hostlist, add new features, and try to make the jobs of users easier.

As you might expect, there are many types of users with different levels of sophistication, and py-hostlist is designed to accommodate both simple and complex use cases for this tool. A user who only knows that he needs a small task, like expanding a hostlist, should be able to type something simple like ``python cla_hostlist.py -e foo[1-4]`` and get a result in return.

Directory Structure
